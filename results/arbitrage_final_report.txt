PROFITABILITY ANALYSIS:
-----------------------
Profitable opportunities found: 86,000
Success rate: 16.66%

Profit statistics:
  - Best opportunity: $1.58
  - Average profit: $0.58
  - Median profit: $0.61
  - Total potential: $49959.75

EXCHANGE PAIR ANALYSIS:
-----------------------
Most profitable pair: coinbase → binance
Opportunities from this pair: 85,979

FEE STRUCTURE ASSUMPTIONS:

- Trade size: $1,000 per opportunity

TECHNICAL IMPLEMENTATION:
-------------------------
- Language: Python 3.x
- Async framework: asyncio
- WebSocket library: websockets
